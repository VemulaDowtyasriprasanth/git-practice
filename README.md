intially the local changesin the code it wil be pushed in to the stagging area with the command called git add. to add all files or git add filename with extension 

After it is pushed into the stagged area we can use a command called git Commit to pushed it into the local repository and when the code from the 
local repository is pushed into the git or remote repository

The code from the remote repositoy can be pulled backed into the local repository with all the commits or all the cganges history by using a 
coonad called git pull 

we can also add a message to the commits that we had done while using git command like git commit -m " some messgae that you wanna add " 


git status is used to know status of the files in the staging area or files those are yet to be commited . 

After all the files are committed then all the files will be in the local repository and are ready to push into remote repository 
it can be done using 

git push 

all the changes in the local repository are updated in the remote repository after this command 

git diff is used to know what were the changes made to the code or to know the changes made to the code 

If the code is added into the staging area after making the changes and then at that moment if we wanna know the differences 

then we have to use git diff -chached or git diff -filename to understand specific file name changes
